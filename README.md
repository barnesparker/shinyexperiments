<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `shinyexperiments` is to provide a
[`shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/) interface to the
[`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) machine learning framework
while preserving and enhancing its underlying data science principles.

This repo is currently in active development and is not yet ready for
use. However, if you are interested in trying out the current version,
you can install it by [cloning the
repo](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first#rstudio-ide)
and running the following command:

``` r

renv::restore()

rhino::app()
```
