The goal of `shinyexperiments` is to provide a
[`shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/) interface to the
[`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) machine learning framework
while preserving and enhancing its underlying data science principles.

This package is currently in active development and is not yet ready for
use. If you are interested in trying out the development version, you
can install and run it by running the following commands

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("barnesparker/shinyexperiments")
shinyexperiments::run_app()
```

# Live Demo (January 9, 2024)
